Welcome to the MCP Demo!

This is a sample text file that demonstrates how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can be used to read files from the filesystem.

Key Features of MCP:
- File system access
- Tool discovery
- Standardized communication between AI agents and external services

This demo shows how an AI agent can:
1. Discover available tools from an MCP server
2. Read files from the filesystem
3. Process and summarize the content
4. Provide helpful responses based on the file contents

The MCP server provides a filesystem interface that allows the AI agent to browse directories, read files, and interact with the file system in a controlled and secure manner.
