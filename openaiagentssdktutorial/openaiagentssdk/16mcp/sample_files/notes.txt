Project Notes - MCP Integration

TODO List:
- [x] Set up MCP filesystem server
- [x] Create basic demo script
- [x] Add sample files
- [ ] Test with different file types
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Create documentation

Key Learnings:
1. MCP provides standardized way for AI agents to interact with external services
2. Filesystem server allows controlled access to specific directories
3. Tools are automatically discovered and made available to the agent
4. Security is built-in with directory restrictions

Next Steps:
- Explore other MCP servers (Git, HTTP, etc.)
- Build more complex workflows
- Integrate with other AI frameworks
