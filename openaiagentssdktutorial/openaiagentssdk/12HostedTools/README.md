# üîß Hosted Tools Example

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine giving your robot friend superpowers to search the internet and look through documents! This code shows how to use OpenAI's built-in tools that let your AI assistant search the web for current information and find relevant content in your documents.

Now, let's go step by step!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Magic Key üóùÔ∏è
```python
from agents import Agent, FileSearchTool, Runner, WebSearchTool, set_default_openai_key
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import asyncio

load_dotenv()

openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
# You would need to set this in your .env file
vector_store_id = os.environ.get("VECTOR_STORE_ID", "your_vector_store_id_here")
```
The AI assistant needs a magic key (API key) to work properly, plus a special ID for where your documents are stored.

This code finds these keys hidden in a secret file (.env) and unlocks them.

## Step 2: Setting the Default API Key üîë
```python
async def main():
    set_default_openai_key(openai_api_key)
```
This sets the OpenAI API key as the default for all agents in our program.

## Step 3: Creating a Research Assistant with Hosted Tools ü§ñ
```python
# Create an agent with hosted tools
research_agent = Agent(
    name="Research Assistant",
    instructions="""
    You are a helpful research assistant that can search the web and retrieve information 
    from documents to provide comprehensive answers.
    
    When answering questions:
    1. Use the WebSearchTool to find current information from the internet
    2. Use the FileSearchTool to find relevant information from stored documents
    3. Combine information from both sources to provide a complete answer
    4. Always cite your sources
    5. If the information is not available or unclear, be honest about limitations
    
    Be concise but thorough in your responses.
    """,
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        FileSearchTool(
            max_num_results=3,
            vector_store_ids=[vector_store_id],
        ),
    ],
)
```
This creates an AI assistant that:
- Can search the web for current information
- Can search through your documents for relevant content
- Combines information from both sources
- Cites its sources properly
- Is instructed to be concise but thorough

## Step 4: Preparing Example Queries üìù
```python
# Example queries that would benefit from web search and file search
queries = [
    "Which coffee shop should I go to, taking into account my preferences and the weather today in SF?",
    "What are the key differences between Python and JavaScript?",
    "Summarize the main points from our company's Q2 financial report."
]
```
These are sample questions that demonstrate the power of combining web search and document search:
1. A question that needs current information (weather) and personal preferences
2. A general knowledge question that could be answered from the web
3. A company-specific question that would require searching through internal documents

## Step 5: Running the Research Assistant üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```python
# Run the first query as an example
print("\n=== Research Query Example ===")
print(f"Query: {queries[0]}")

try:
    result = await Runner.run(research_agent, queries[0])
    print("\nResponse:")
    print(result.final_output)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nError: {e}")
    print("\nNote: To use WebSearchTool and FileSearchTool, you need:")
    print("1. Proper API keys configured")
    print("2. A valid vector store ID for FileSearchTool")
    print("3. Access to the OpenAI hosted tools")
```
This runs the research assistant with the first sample question and:
1. Displays the query being processed
2. Shows the AI's response if successful
3. Provides helpful error information if the tools aren't properly configured

## Step 6: Creating an Interactive Research Mode üí¨
```python
# Interactive mode
print("\n=== Interactive Research Mode ===")
print("Type 'exit' to quit")
print("Note: This requires proper configuration of API keys and vector store IDs")

while True:
    user_input = input("\nYour research question: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    
    try:
        print("Researching... (this may take a moment)")
        result = await Runner.run(research_agent, user_input)
        print("\nResearch results:")
        print(result.final_output)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nError: {e}")
```
This creates an interactive mode where:
- You can ask your own research questions
- The AI searches the web and your documents
- It shows a "Researching..." message while working
- It combines information to give you comprehensive answers
- It handles errors gracefully
- You can type "exit" to quit

## Final Summary üìå
‚úÖ We created a research assistant with web search capabilities
‚úÖ We gave it access to search through our documents
‚úÖ We instructed it to combine information from multiple sources
‚úÖ We provided example queries that demonstrate its capabilities
‚úÖ We created an interactive research mode for asking questions
‚úÖ We added error handling for when the tools aren't properly configured

## Try It Yourself! üöÄ
1. Install the required packages:
   ```
   uv add openai-agents python-dotenv
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key and vector store ID:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VECTOR_STORE_ID=your_vector_store_id_here
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   uv run hostedtools.py
   ```
4. Ask research questions that require current and stored information!
