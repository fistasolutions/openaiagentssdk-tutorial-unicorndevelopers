# üîç Input Filters Example

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine having a customer service system where you can transform customer messages before they reach specialists! This code shows how to create input filters that can add context, remove sensitive information, or add system instructions before messages are handed off to specialized agents.

Now, let's go step by step!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Magic Key üóùÔ∏è
```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, Runner, set_default_openai_key
from agents.extensions import handoff_filters
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
from typing import List, Dict, Any

load_dotenv()

openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
set_default_openai_key(openai_api_key)
```
The AI assistants need a magic key (API key) to work properly.

This code finds the OpenAI API key hidden in a secret file (.env), unlocks it, and sets it as the default key for our agents.

## Step 2: Creating Custom Input Filters üßπ
```python
# Create a custom input filter that adds context about the customer
def add_customer_context(input_text: str) -> str:
    return f"""
Customer context: Gold tier member since 2019, prefers email communication, has purchased premium plan.

Customer inquiry: {input_text}
"""

# Create a custom wrapper for remove_all_tools for demonstration purposes
def demo_remove_all_tools(input_text: str) -> str:
    # This is a simplified version just for demonstration
    return "This would remove all tool references from: " + input_text

# Create a custom input filter that adds system instructions
def add_system_instructions(input_text: str) -> str:
    return f"""
SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be concise and direct in your responses
- Use bullet points for lists
- Avoid technical jargon unless necessary
- Always confirm understanding before proceeding

USER QUERY:
{input_text}
"""

# Create a custom input filter that sanitizes sensitive information
def sanitize_sensitive_info(input_text: str) -> str:
    # In a real implementation, this would use regex or more sophisticated methods
    # to identify and redact sensitive information
    sanitized = input_text
    sanitized = sanitized.replace("credit card", "[PAYMENT METHOD]")
    sanitized = sanitized.replace("SSN", "[REDACTED ID]")
    sanitized = sanitized.replace("password", "[CREDENTIALS]")
    sanitized = sanitized.replace("account number", "[ACCOUNT ID]")
    
    # Add a note about sanitization if changes were made
    if sanitized != input_text:
        sanitized += "\n\n[Note: Some sensitive information has been redacted for security purposes.]"
    
    return sanitized
```
This creates four different input filters:
- `add_customer_context`: Adds information about the customer's status and preferences
- `demo_remove_all_tools`: Demonstrates how to remove tool references (simplified version)
- `add_system_instructions`: Adds formatting and style instructions for the agent
- `sanitize_sensitive_info`: Replaces sensitive information with redacted placeholders

Each filter takes an input text and returns a modified version of that text.

## Step 3: Creating Specialized Agents üë®‚Äçüíºüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíº
```python
# Create specialized agents for different purposes
faq_agent = Agent(
    name="FAQ Agent",
    instructions="""
    You are an FAQ specialist who provides clear, concise answers to common questions.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Provide accurate information about our products and services
    2. Answer frequently asked questions efficiently
    3. Direct users to relevant resources when appropriate
    4. Keep responses brief and to the point
    
    Stick to answering common questions and avoid lengthy explanations unless necessary.
    """,
)

technical_agent = Agent(
    name="Technical Agent",
    instructions="""
    You are a technical support specialist who helps users with complex technical issues.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Troubleshoot technical problems step by step
    2. Provide clear instructions for resolving issues
    3. Explain technical concepts in accessible language
    4. Recommend best practices for using our products
    
    Be thorough but clear in your explanations, and focus on practical solutions.
    """,
)

billing_agent = Agent(
    name="Billing Agent",
    instructions="""
    You are a billing specialist who handles financial and account-related inquiries.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Address questions about billing and payments
    2. Explain pricing plans and subscription options
    3. Help with account management issues
    4. Provide information about refunds and credits
    
    Be precise and transparent about financial matters, and maintain customer privacy.
    """,
)
```
This creates three specialized agents:
- An FAQ agent who answers common questions
- A technical agent who helps with technical issues
- A billing agent who handles financial inquiries

## Step 4: Creating Handoff Objects with Input Filters üîÑ
```python
# Create handoff objects with different input filters
faq_handoff = handoff(
    agent=faq_agent,
    input_filter=handoff_filters.remove_all_tools,  # This is fine as it will be used correctly in handoff
    tool_name_override="ask_faq_specialist",
    tool_description_override="Transfer to an FAQ specialist for answers to common questions.",
)

technical_handoff = handoff(
    agent=technical_agent,
    input_filter=add_system_instructions,  # Add system instructions to the input
    tool_name_override="get_technical_support",
    tool_description_override="Transfer to a technical specialist for help with technical issues.",
)

billing_handoff = handoff(
    agent=billing_agent,
    input_filter=lambda text: sanitize_sensitive_info(add_customer_context(text)),  # Chain multiple filters
    tool_name_override="contact_billing_department",
    tool_description_override="Transfer to the billing department for help with account and payment issues.",
)
```
This creates handoff objects that:
- Connect to the specialized agents
- Apply different input filters to the messages
- Use professional tool names and descriptions

Note how each handoff uses a different input filter strategy:
1. The FAQ handoff uses a built-in filter to remove tool references
2. The technical handoff adds system instructions
3. The billing handoff chains multiple filters together (sanitize + add context)

## Step 5: Creating a Main Agent with Tools and Filtered Handoffs ü§ñ
```python
# Create a main agent that can hand off to specialized agents with filtered inputs
main_agent = Agent(
    name="Customer Service Agent",
    instructions="""
    You are the primary customer service agent. Your role is to:
    
    1. Greet customers and understand their initial needs
    2. Handle simple inquiries directly
    3. Direct customers to the appropriate specialized agent when needed:
       - FAQ Specialist: For common questions about our products and services
       - Technical Support: For help with technical issues and troubleshooting
       - Billing Department: For questions about billing, payments, and accounts
    
    Before transferring a customer, briefly explain why you're connecting them with a specialist
    and what they can expect from the handoff.
    
    You have access to customer tools that should not be shared with other agents.
    """,
    handoffs=[
        faq_handoff,
        technical_handoff,
        billing_handoff,
    ],
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "access_customer_database",
                "description": "Access the customer database to retrieve customer information",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "customer_id": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The customer's ID"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["customer_id"]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "update_customer_record",
                "description": "Update the customer's record in the database",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "customer_id": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The customer's ID"
                        },
                        "field": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The field to update"
                        },
                        "value": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "The new value for the field"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": ["customer_id", "field", "value"]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
)
```
This creates a main customer service agent that:
- Handles general inquiries
- Has access to customer database tools
- Uses our handoff objects with input filters
- Explains handoffs to customers

The main agent has tools that should not be shared with specialists, which is why the `remove_all_tools` filter is important.

## Step 6: Demonstrating the Effect of Input Filters üß™
```python
# Function to demonstrate the effect of input filters
def demonstrate_filters():
    sample_input = "I need help with my account number 12345-6789. My credit card isn't working and I forgot my password."
    
    print("=== Input Filter Demonstration ===\n")
    print(f"Original input: \"{sample_input}\"\n")
    
    print("After demo_remove_all_tools (simulating handoff_filters.remove_all_tools):")
    print(f"\"{demo_remove_all_tools(sample_input)}\"\n")
    
    print("After add_customer_context:")
    print(f"\"{add_customer_context(sample_input)}\"\n")
    
    print("After add_system_instructions:")
    print(f"\"{add_system_instructions(sample_input)}\"\n")
    
    print("After sanitize_sensitive_info:")
    print(f"\"{sanitize_sensitive_info(sample_input)}\"\n")
    
    print("After chaining filters (sanitize + add_customer_context):")
    print(f"\"{sanitize_sensitive_info(add_customer_context(sample_input))}\"\n")
```
This function:
- Takes a sample input with sensitive information
- Shows how each filter transforms the input
- Demonstrates chaining multiple filters together
- Provides a visual demonstration of the filters' effects

## Step 7: Testing with Different Customer Inquiries üß™
```python
# Example customer inquiries for different scenarios
faq_inquiry = "What are the differences between your Basic, Premium, and Enterprise plans?"
technical_inquiry = "I'm having trouble connecting my device to Wi-Fi. I've tried restarting it but it still won't connect."
billing_inquiry = "I was charged twice for my subscription this month. My account number is ABC-12345 and I paid with my credit card ending in 7890."

# Test the main agent with different inquiries
print("\n=== FAQ Inquiry Example ===")
print(f"Customer: {faq_inquiry}")

try:
    result = await Runner.run(main_agent, input=faq_inquiry)
    print("\nFinal Response:")
    print(result.final_output)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nError: {e}")
    print("Skipping this example due to error.")
```
This tests the system with different types of customer inquiries:
1. An FAQ inquiry about plan differences
2. A technical inquiry about Wi-Fi connectivity
3. A billing inquiry with sensitive information

Each inquiry should trigger a different handoff with a different input filter.

## Step 8: Creating an Interactive Customer Service Mode üí¨
```python
# Interactive mode
print("\n=== Interactive Customer Service Mode ===")
print("Type 'exit' to quit")

while True:
    user_input = input("\nYour inquiry: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    
    print("Processing...")
    try:
        result = await Runner.run(main_agent, input=user_input)
        print("\nFinal Response:")
        print(result.final_output)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nError: {e}")
        print("Could not process your inquiry due to an error.")
```
This creates an interactive mode where:
- You can type any customer service inquiry
- The main agent will handle it or hand it off with filtered input
- Error handling is included for robustness
- You can type "exit" to quit
