# üìã Handoff Inputs Example

## What This Code Does (Big Picture)
Imagine a customer service system where agents can pass detailed, structured information when transferring customers to specialists! This code shows how to create handoffs with structured data models, ensuring that all the important customer information is properly collected and passed along during transfers.

Now, let's go step by step!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Magic Key üóùÔ∏è
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, List
import asyncio
import json

from agents import Agent, handoff, RunContextWrapper, Runner, set_default_openai_key
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

openai_api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
set_default_openai_key(openai_api_key)
```
The AI assistants need a magic key (API key) to work properly.

This code finds the OpenAI API key hidden in a secret file (.env), unlocks it, and sets it as the default key for our agents.

## Step 2: Creating Structured Data Models for Handoffs üìä
```python
# Define structured data models for different handoff scenarios
class EscalationData(BaseModel):
    reason: str = Field(..., description="The reason for escalation")
    priority: str = Field(..., description="Priority level (low, medium, high, urgent)")
    attempted_solutions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Solutions already attempted")

class CustomerData(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(..., description="Customer's name")
    account_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Customer's account ID if available")
    issue_category: str = Field(..., description="Category of the customer's issue")
    is_premium: bool = Field(description="Whether the customer has premium status")

class TechnicalIssueData(BaseModel):
    product_name: str = Field(..., description="Name of the product with the issue")
    error_code: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Error code if applicable")
    system_info: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Customer's system information")
    steps_to_reproduce: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list, description="Steps to reproduce the issue")
```
This creates three structured data models:
- `EscalationData`: For escalating issues, including reason, priority, and attempted solutions
- `CustomerData`: For premium customer transfers, including name, account ID, and status
- `TechnicalIssueData`: For technical issues, including product details, error codes, and reproduction steps

Each field has a description that helps the AI understand what information to collect.

## Step 3: Creating Handoff Callback Functions That Use Structured Data üîÑ
```python
# Define handoff callback functions that use the structured data
async def on_escalation_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], input_data: EscalationData):
    print("\n[SYSTEM] Escalation process initiated")
    print(f"[SYSTEM] Reason for escalation: {input_data.reason}")
    print(f"[SYSTEM] Priority level: {input_data.priority}")
    if input_data.attempted_solutions:
        print("[SYSTEM] Solutions already attempted:")
        for i, solution in enumerate(input_data.attempted_solutions, 1):
            print(f"[SYSTEM]   {i}. {solution}")
    print("[SYSTEM] Notifying supervisor and preparing case file")

async def on_premium_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], input_data: CustomerData):
    print("\n[SYSTEM] Premium customer service handoff initiated")
    print(f"[SYSTEM] Customer name: {input_data.name}")
    if input_data.account_id:
        print(f"[SYSTEM] Account ID: {input_data.account_id}")
    print(f"[SYSTEM] Issue category: {input_data.issue_category}")
    print(f"[SYSTEM] Premium status: {'Yes' if input_data.is_premium else 'No'}")
    print("[SYSTEM] Loading customer history and preferences")
    print("[SYSTEM] Preparing personalized greeting and expedited service options")

async def on_technical_handoff(ctx: RunContextWrapper[None], input_data: TechnicalIssueData):
    print("\n[SYSTEM] Technical support handoff initiated")
    print(f"[SYSTEM] Product: {input_data.product_name}")
    if input_data.error_code:
        print(f"[SYSTEM] Error code: {input_data.error_code}")
    if input_data.system_info:
        print(f"[SYSTEM] System information: {input_data.system_info}")
    if input_data.steps_to_reproduce:
        print("[SYSTEM] Steps to reproduce:")
        for i, step in enumerate(input_data.steps_to_reproduce, 1):
            print(f"[SYSTEM]   {i}. {step}")
    print("[SYSTEM] Searching knowledge base for known solutions")
    print("[SYSTEM] Preparing diagnostic tools")
```
These callback functions:
- Take a context object and the structured input data
- Process the structured data during handoffs
- Display system messages showing the information being processed
- Simulate backend actions like notifying supervisors or searching knowledge bases

## Step 4: Creating Specialized Agents üë®‚Äçüíºüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüîß
```python
# Create specialized agents
escalation_agent = Agent(
    name="Escalation Specialist",
    instructions="""
    You are an escalation specialist who handles complex or high-priority issues.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Address customer concerns that couldn't be resolved by the first-line support
    2. Handle complaints and sensitive situations
    3. Provide solutions for complex problems
    4. Coordinate with other departments when necessary
    5. Ensure customer satisfaction for difficult cases
    
    Be empathetic but professional, and focus on finding effective solutions quickly.
    """,
)

premium_agent = Agent(
    name="Premium Customer Agent",
    instructions="""
    You are a premium customer service agent who provides enhanced support to our valued premium customers.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Provide personalized, white-glove service to premium customers
    2. Offer expedited solutions and special accommodations
    3. Proactively address potential issues
    4. Ensure premium customers feel valued and appreciated
    5. Go above and beyond standard service protocols
    
    Be exceptionally courteous, attentive, and solution-oriented.
    """,
)

technical_agent = Agent(
    name="Technical Specialist",
    instructions="""
    You are a technical specialist with deep expertise in our products and services.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    1. Solve complex technical issues that require specialized knowledge
    2. Provide detailed technical explanations and guidance
    3. Troubleshoot difficult problems with systematic approaches
    4. Recommend advanced solutions and workarounds
    5. Document technical issues for product improvement
    
    Be thorough, precise, and methodical in your approach to technical problems.
    """,
)
```
This creates three specialized agents:
- An escalation specialist for handling complex or high-priority issues
- A premium customer agent for providing enhanced support to premium customers
- A technical specialist for solving complex technical problems

## Step 5: Creating Handoff Objects with Structured Input Types üîÑ
```python
# Create handoff objects with structured input types
escalation_handoff = handoff(
    agent=escalation_agent,
    on_handoff=on_escalation_handoff,
    input_type=EscalationData,
    tool_name_override="escalate_to_specialist",
    tool_description_override="Escalate the issue to a specialist for handling complex or high-priority cases.",
)

premium_handoff = handoff(
    agent=premium_agent,
    on_handoff=on_premium_handoff,
    input_type=CustomerData,
    tool_name_override="transfer_to_premium_service",
    tool_description_override="Transfer the customer to our premium service team for enhanced support.",
)

technical_handoff = handoff(
    agent=technical_agent,
    on_handoff=on_technical_handoff,
    input_type=TechnicalIssueData,
    tool_name_override="connect_with_technical_specialist",
    tool_description_override="Connect the customer with a technical specialist for advanced troubleshooting.",
)
```
This creates handoff objects that:
- Connect to the specialized agents
- Use our callback functions for processing handoffs
- Specify the structured input type for each handoff
- Use professional tool names and descriptions

The key innovation here is the `input_type` parameter, which tells the AI what structured data to collect before handoff.

## Step 6: Creating a Main Agent with Structured Handoffs ü§ñ
```python
# Create a main agent that can hand off to specialized agents with structured data
main_agent = Agent(
    name="Customer Service Agent",
    instructions="""
    You are the primary customer service agent. Your role is to:
    
    1. Assist customers with general inquiries and simple issues
    2. Identify when a case needs to be handled by a specialist
    3. Collect relevant information before transferring to a specialist
    4. Use the appropriate handoff tool with complete information:
    
       - For complex or high-priority issues, use escalate_to_specialist with:
         * reason: Clear description of why escalation is needed
         * priority: Appropriate level (low, medium, high, urgent)
         * attempted_solutions: List of solutions you've already tried
    
       - For premium customers, use transfer_to_premium_service with:
         * name: Customer's name
         * account_id: Customer's account ID if available
         * issue_category: Category of their issue
         * is_premium: Set to true for premium customers
    
       - For technical issues, use connect_with_technical_specialist with:
         * product_name: Name of the product with the issue
         * error_code: Error code if mentioned
         * system_info: Customer's system information if provided
         * steps_to_reproduce: Steps to reproduce the issue
    
    Always collect as much relevant information as possible before handoff.
    """,
    handoffs=[
        escalation_handoff,
        premium_handoff,
        technical_handoff,
    ],
)
```
This creates a main customer service agent that:
- Handles general inquiries
- Identifies when a specialist is needed
- Collects all relevant information before handoff
- Uses the appropriate handoff tool with structured data
- Has detailed instructions about what information to collect for each handoff type

## Step 7: Testing with Different Customer Inquiries üß™
```python
# Example customer inquiries for different scenarios
escalation_inquiry = "I've been trying to resolve an issue with my account for three days and nobody has helped me. I'm extremely frustrated and considering canceling my service. This is unacceptable!"

premium_inquiry = "Hello, I'm Sarah Johnson, a premium member since 2018. My account number is PRE-12345. I need assistance with updating my payment method."

technical_inquiry = "My XYZ-3000 printer is showing error code E-503 when I try to print. I'm using Windows 11, and I've already tried restarting the printer and checking the ink levels. The error appears after I click print and the printer makes a clicking sound."

# Test the main agent with different inquiries
print("=== Escalation Example ===")
print(f"Customer: {escalation_inquiry}")

result = await Runner.run(main_agent, input=escalation_inquiry)
print("\nFinal Response:")
print(result.final_output)
```
This tests the system with different types of customer inquiries:
1. An escalation case from a frustrated customer
2. A premium customer with account information
3. A technical issue with detailed error information

## Step 8: Testing All Inquiry Types üîÑ
```python
print("\n=== Premium Customer Example ===")
print(f"Customer: {premium_inquiry}")

result = await Runner.run(main_agent, input=premium_inquiry)
print("\nFinal Response:")
print(result.final_output)

print("\n=== Technical Issue Example ===")
print(f"Customer: {technical_inquiry}")

result = await Runner.run(main_agent, input=technical_inquiry)
print("\nFinal Response:")
print(result.final_output)
```
This continues testing with the remaining inquiry types to see how the main agent collects and passes structured data during handoffs.

## Step 9: Creating an Interactive Customer Service Mode üí¨
```python
# Interactive mode
print("\n=== Interactive Customer Service Mode ===")
print("Type 'exit' to quit")

while True:
    user_input = input("\nYour inquiry: ")
    if user_input.lower() == 'exit':
        break
    
    print("Processing...")
    result = await Runner.run(main_agent, input=user_input)
    print("\nFinal Response:")
    print(result.final_output)
```
This creates an interactive mode where:
- You can type any customer service inquiry
- The main agent will collect structured data if needed
- Handoffs will trigger the appropriate callback functions
- You can see the system messages showing the structured data
- You can type "exit" to quit
